/*

From the rightmost digit, which is the check digit, and moving left, double the value of every second digit. If the result of this doubling operation is greater than 9 (e.g., 8 × 2 = 16), then add the digits of the product (e.g., 16 1 + 6 = 7, 18 1 + 8 = 9) or, alternatively, the same result can be found by subtracting 9 from the product (e.g., 16 16 - 9 = 7, 18 18 - 9 = 9).
Take the sum of all the digits.
If the total modulo 10 is equal to 0 (if the total ends in zero) then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid.
